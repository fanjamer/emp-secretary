Echoic Mobile Press's Discord Server's Bot

### _We begin with a noob named Jacob._
Jacob likes coding. He wanted to work on his favorite chat platform, ***DISCORD***, to make a bot.  
He stalled for a **LONG TIME**, but ***finally*** began the bot on *June 4th, 2017*. This is where our adventure begins

Our hero journeyed through the slightly scary world of [*Slack*][slack link] and [*GitHub*][github link].
