Echoic Mobile Press's Discord Server's Bot

### _We begin with a noob named Jacob (a.k.a. Nooblet)._
Jacob likes coding. He wanted to work on his favorite chat platform, ***DISCORD***, to make a bot.  
He stalled for a **LONG TIME**, but ***finally*** began the bot on *June 4th, 2017*. This is where our adventure begins

The first step on the adventure is to complete the basic coding. Our Hero found the zeroes and ones needed and completed the following: [click for the checklist][basic stuff image]

Our hero next journeyed through the slightly scary world of [*Slack*][slack link] and [*GitHub*][github link].

After getting his *stuff* together, our hero takes a short break (_6/5 to 6/6_).

##### _Intermission ended! It's summer! (For the most part) no more taking breaks!

Our hero continued his journey, and completed a self-ranking system.

Now he hopes to make our bland bot buddy into a jovial music bot!
